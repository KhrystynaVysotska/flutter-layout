# Flutter: widget tree
#### This project involves next points:
- replicate the layout of a **single** screen of your favorite app
- **layout** includes elements it contains and how they are aligned relative to each other
- no need to use pictures/animations, you can use **dummy text**
- layout must be **responsive**
